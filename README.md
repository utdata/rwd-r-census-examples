# Census project examples using R

There are very basic and brief examples of several R packages that use the Census APIs. It is not a comprehensive list or tutorial.

## Published notebooks

- [01-censusapi](https://utdata.github.io/rwd-r-census-examples/01-censusapi.html) uses the [censusapi](https://hrecht.github.io/censusapi/) for census data and the [tigirs](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package for spatial geometry.
- [01-tidycensus](https://utdata.github.io/rwd-r-census-examples/01-tidycensus.html) uses the [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html) package for both data and geometry.
